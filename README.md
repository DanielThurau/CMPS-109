# Simple-RuleBase-Inference-Engine

"In the field of Artificial Intelligence, inference engine is a component of the system that applies logical 
rules to the knowledge base to deduce new information." -Wikipedia.

In my Advanced Programming class (CMPS-109 @ UCSC), we used OOP principled to implement a client/server model 
of a RuleBased Inference Engine.
